# c++TOPBase

Basic TouchDesigner c++ TOP example that reads the pixels from an input TOP and writes those pixels back to the CPlusPlus TOP.

## Usage

Open the xcode project and build (âŒ˜ B) the bundle, copy it frome the build location (usually somewhere in the deriveddata folder)
Create a CPlusPlus TOP and load the .bundle

This should work out of the box on macOS and Windows (not tested on Windows though).

Edit ```CppTOP.hpp``` and ```CppTOP.cpp``` to add your own code.
